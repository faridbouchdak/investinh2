<p class="mb-6"><strong>intro:</strong> We are a team of passionate individuals committed to making a positive impact on the world through our work. Together, we strive to help the public sector achieve its energy transition goals and create a sustainable future for generations to come. Our journey began with an unwavering belief in the power of renewable energy and our shared mission to combat climate change.</p>
<p class="mb-6"><strong>our story:</strong> Every day, we wake up driven by a collective sense of purpose and a deep-rooted desire to make a difference. We understand that transitioning to clean energy is not just about reducing carbon emissions; it is about transforming lives, communities, and the very fabric of our society. It is about empowering individuals and businesses alike to embrace alternative sources of energy while fostering economic growth.</p>
<p class="mb-6"><strong>our past struggle:</strong> As we navigate through this complex process, we not only bring expertise but also empathy, as we recognize that change can be daunting. We value collaboration and actively engage with stakeholders at every step – listening, learning, and adapting together. Our commitment extends beyond providing services; it lies in building long-lasting relationships based on trust and shared values.</p>
<p class="mb-6"><strong>our mission:</strong> Together with our clients, partners and communities, we envision a future where renewable energy sources are central.</p> 
<p class="mb-6"><strong>what we can do for you:</strong> We're a company of four because we believe the best results come from a direct partnership with clients.</p>
<p class="mb-6">In other words, we do the work and we maintain the relationship. No sales reps, no account execs, no big guns trying to represent the work of someone else. Simply a couple of co-owners – 1 financial and procurement expert, 1 project and contract management expert, 1 project management and feasibility expert, 1 policy and financial expert – motivated to listen and serve.</p>
<p class="mb-6">If you think we’d be a good fit for your next project, please reach out and <a href="/contact">inquire with us</a>. We look forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
