### Procurement<br/>& implementation

We prepare bid documents and contracts, conducting a competitive bidding process to select contractors and suppliers. Awards are given to the winning bidders, and the physical construction of the energy infrastructure project commences.

Project management and quality control measures are implemented to ensure the project remains on schedule and within budget. Additionally, we monitor and address any unexpected issues or changes that may arise.

Key Features:

- Bid document preparation
- Competitive bidding process
- Contractor and supplier selection
- Contract awarding and negotiation
- Contract management and compliance
