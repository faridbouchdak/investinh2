## Hydrogen Energy

Hydrogen Energy has emerged as a promising cleaner alternative to fossil fuels. With the growing concerns over climate change and the detrimental impact of fossil fuels, experts are leaning towards hydrogen as a more efficient means to decarbonize various industries.

### A cleaner alternative to fossil fuels

Hydrogen is not just abundant but also occurs naturally; making it the most widespread substance in the universe. Clean hydrogen, specifically, refers to hydrogen production with minimal to zero carbon emissions, generally through renewable power sources or via biofuels. Studies have shown that by incorporating hydrogen alongside other green energy technologies, we can witness over 20% of emissions reductions by 2050.

### Green, Blue and Gray Hydrogen

There are different types of hydrogen production based on their greenhouse gas emissions. Green hydrogen involves the use of renewable electricity to break down water into hydrogen and oxygen through a process called electrolysis. This method results in no greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, traditional production of hydrogen from fossil fuels, such as natural gas, inevitably leads to carbon emissions. Depending on whether and how these carbon emissions are captured and stored, this can result in blue or gray hydrogen.

### Decarbonisation

A significant reason why hydrogen has gained attention in energy discussions is its potential role in lowering carbon emissions in sectors, notoriously difficult to decarbonize, such as steel production and long-haul transportation. Steel production is particularly notable, accounting for 8% of global emissions. Hydrogen can help such sectors transition away from carbon-intensive operations.

In the context of transportation, hydrogen combustion engines can help the sector meet increasingly stringent regulations on vehicle emissions, particularly in regions like Europe and the United States.

> From a global perspective, numerous large-scale hydrogen projects have been announced, with a cumulative investment of $320 billion.

### Not without challenges

The shift to hydrogen energy is not without challenges. The hydrogen value chain is capital-intensive and complex. Additionally, technology advancements and regulation development are progressing at uneven rates across the world. Even after substantial investments in large-scale hydrogen projects — over $320 billion worldwide — an investment of $460 billion is still required by 2030 to address funding gaps in production, infrastructure, and end-use applications.

Countries with abundant hydrocarbon resources will play instrumental roles in scaling competitive hydrogen supply, stimulating local demand, developing transportation technology, and facilitating cooperation across industries and nations. It emphasizes the importance of governments, industry stakeholders, and international cooperation in accelerating the global development and adoption of clean hydrogen energy.

## Conclusion

However, there are also substantial hurdles to overcome for achieving widespread hydrogen adoption. Investment costs, particularly for scaling infrastructure across production, transportation, and utilization of hydrogen, are significantly high. Nations need to foster international cooperation to adequately develop clean hydrogen supply chains. To truly unlock the potential of hydrogen for the purpose of emissions reductions, governments and stakeholders from the private sector need to come together and initiate key actions that drive demand. Thus, while hydrogen energy holds immense potential, its eventual success hinges on overcoming these challenges and thoughtfully harnessing its potential.
