# Hydrogen at the New Delhi G20 Leaders’ Summit of 2023
> New Delhi, India, 9-10 September 2023

G20 leaders met in New Delhi on the 9th and 10th of September, 2023. The [Leaders' Declaration](https://www.g20.org/content/dam/gtwenty/gtwenty_new/document/G20-New-Delhi-Leaders-Declaration.pdf) highlights a continued emphasis on sustainable and inclusive economic growth, with infrastructure and energy transitions playing a crucial role.

The declaration asserts that "no country should have to choose between fighting poverty and fighting for our planet". To support just energy transitions, the leaders proposed several specific measures. These include striving for low-cost financing to aid developing countries in their transitions, expediting global markets for hydrogen produced using zero and low-emission technologies, and acknowledging the importance of resilient energy infrastructure as well as regional and cross-border power systems integration.

Art. 38. III: Support the acceleration of production, utilization, as well as the development of
transparent and resilient global markets for <span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-green-50 px-2 py-1 text-green-700 ring-1 ring-inset ring-green-600/20">hydrogen</span> produced from zero and low-emission technologies and its derivatives such as ammonia, by developing voluntary and mutually agreed harmonising standards as well as mutually
recognised and inter-operable certification schemes. To realise this, we affirm the
‘G20 High Level Voluntary Principles on Hydrogen’, to build a sustainable and
equitable <span class="inline-flex items-center rounded-md bg-green-50 px-2 py-1 text-green-700 ring-1 ring-inset ring-green-600/20">global hydrogen ecosystem</span> that benefits all nations.

We intend to support voluntary principles to enable emission
reduction, in all sectors, and work towards addressing
sustainability aspects. This will contribute to achieving global net
zero GHG emissions/carbon, neutrality goals by accelerating
measures towards the production, utilization, and trade of
hydrogen produced from zero and low emission technologies and
its derivatives such as ammonia. For this purpose, we welcome the
following five high-level guiding voluntary principles on Hydrogen:<br/>
1. Encourage collaboration on the development of national standards and work towards globally harmonized approach to certification for hydrogen produced from zero and low emission technologies and its derivatives such as ammonia.<br/>
2. Promote free and fair trade of hydrogen produced from zero and low emission technologies and its derivatives such as ammonia in line with WTO rules, supported by resilient and diversified supply chains.<br/>
3. Accelerate technological innovation, business models, and R&D collaboration to enhance international cooperation.<br/>
4. Promote investments, mobilize finance, and develop infrastructure for enhancing the production, utilization, and global trade of hydrogen produced from zero and low emission technologies and its derivatives such as ammonia.<br/>
5. Support and enable voluntary information sharing, cooperation, dialogue, knowledge exchange, and capacity building on hydrogen produced from zero and low emission technologies and its derivatives such as ammonia, with an aim to contribute to net zero GHG emissions/carbon neutral pathways, including through the development of regional and international initiatives and institutions.</span>
