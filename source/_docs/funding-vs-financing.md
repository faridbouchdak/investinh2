Funding is the money provided by organizations - often governmental - to businesses and individuals to carry out specific projects, while financing is a broader term referring to the act of providing money for a venture, whether in the form of debt (loan) or equity (share selling).

Funding is non-repayable (or free) and often comes out from taxes or donations. However, financing requires repayment as it is essentially loaning out money in expectation of a return on investment (ROI).

Financing is often used for long term, high-cost investments like infrastructure, machinery or real estate, requiring a detailed business plan, while funding is typically for short-term projects, with the expectation of societal or environmental improvements.

Whereas funding comes with strings attached, directions on use, and often requires progress reports, financing is less restrictive, providing businesses freedom on the spend but with the obligation of repayment with interest or dividends.

Funding sources include government, non-profit organizations or research councils, and financing sources include financial institutions/banks, investors and venture capitalists.
